# Mission to Mars

## Overview of Project
> Robin wants to add four of the Mar's hemisphere images to her web app and make it Scraping friendly too. To do this, We’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter 
to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, 
and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. 

1. ***Deliverable 1***: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
2. ***Deliverable 2***: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
3. ***Deliverable 3***: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
4. ***Extra***: A written report on the Mission-to-Mars Web App analysis

## Resources:

* Data Source: `Mission_to_Mars.ipynb`, `app.py`, `scraping.py` and `index.html`
* Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB
* Software: MongoDB, Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Flask Version 1.0.2

 

## Deliverable 1:  Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, we will scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

-Code is written that retrieves the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image 
-The full-resolution images of the hemispheres are added to the dictionary.
-The titles for the hemisphere images are added to the dictionary.
-The list contains the dictionary of the full-resolution image URL string and title for each hemisphere image

## Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars’s Hemisphere Images and Titles
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using your Python and HTML skills, we will add the code created in Deliverable 1 to our `scraping.py` file, update our Mongo database, and modify the `index_new.html` file so the webpage
 contains all the information, collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image

1. The `scraping.py` file contains code that retrieves the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image. 
2. The Mongo database is updated to contain the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
3. ​The index_new.html file contains code that will display the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
4. After the scraping has been completed, the web app contains all the information from this module and the full-resolution images and titles for the four hemisphere images.


 
### Results:


-Mission-to Mars web page before adding the Hemispheres:

## Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
### Deliverable Requirements:

For this part of the Challenge, update our web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.

1. The webpage is mobile-responsive. 
2. Two additional Bootstrap 3 components are used to style the webpage.

 
### Results:

1. **The webpage is mobile-responsive.**

-Ipad Pro view
